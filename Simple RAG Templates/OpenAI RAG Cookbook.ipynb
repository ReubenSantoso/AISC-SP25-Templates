The taste is so sweet, and it's not just the aftertaste as a previous commenter said.  This soup is horrible!  It tastes nothing like true Cajun red beans and rice.  I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, \"eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it,\" but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was \"healthy\" or \"low fat\" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE. THIS SOUP SUCKS.\n","---\n","Title: Arrived Fine; Content: The product arrived pretty quickly and was easy to make, tasted very good.

However, each cup contains about 3 tortellinis. This is supposed to be a double serving bowl, but 1.5 tortellini isn't much of a meal. It tastes good and I like all the veggies (plus it has low sodium) but I really wish they would include a couple more tortellini.\n","\n","\n","Q: Are customers happy with the food's texture?\n","A: Based on the provided customer reviews, there is no specific mention of customers commenting on the food's texture.
