I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, \"eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it,\" but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was \"healthy\" or \"low fat\" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE.
